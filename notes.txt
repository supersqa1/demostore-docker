New version of the site created 2024-10-26

The way the site is created is first the it is created from scratch using latest version WP and Mysql
Then the data is dumped. Then new image is created that contains the data.



Notes:

v2: still in progress
* it works but it always ask to update db and it just works no problem after that


v2-w--from-backup

for some reason it gives this error
+ sleep 1
my_wordpress_container5  | + [[ 54 -lt 180 ]]
my_wordpress_container5  | + wp core is-installed --allow-root
my_wordpress_container5  | [27-Oct-2024 21:05:39 UTC] PHP Warning:  Undefined array key "HTTP_HOST" in /var/www/html/wp-includes/functions.php on line 6298
my_wordpress_container5  | Warning: Undefined array key "HTTP_HOST" in /var/www/html/wp-includes/functions.php on line 6298
my_wordpress_container5  | + sleep 1


that is if we have build image command in the yml
but if we build the image ahead of time  then it work jsut fine

but required to manually recover the site from the ui using wpvivid
